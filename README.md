## Savita's Boutique (Fashion Retail) Point of Sales Data Analysis (Python Coding Using Generative AI, Prompt Engineering)
### Overview
Welcome to the repository for the analysis of Savita's Boutique point of sales data. In this project, we dive into the world of retail analytics, exploring customer clusters, supplier insights, and more, all powered by the efficiency of generative AI.

### ***How Generative AI Streamlines the Analysis***
1. **RFM Analysis with Speed and Precision**
What is RFM? - Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) analysis is a powerful method to understand customer behavior.
Generative AI's Role - By leveraging generative AI, particularly GPT-3.5, we automated code generation for complex RFM calculations. This significantly sped up the process and ensured precision in defining customer segments.
2. **Elbow Method for Customer Clustering**
What is Elbow Method? - It helps determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset.
Generative AI's Role - The algorithm for elbow method analysis was swiftly generated using GPT-3.5. This allowed for quick experimentation with various cluster counts and facilitated effective segmentation of customers.
3. **Price Sensitivity Analysis Made Easy**
Why Price Sensitivity Analysis? - Understanding how changes in price impact quantity sold is crucial for pricing strategies.
Generative AI's Role - We employed generative AI to create a linear regression model for price sensitivity. This streamlined the process, from data preparation to model evaluation, making the analysis straightforward and efficient.
4. **Customer Journey Mapping Visualization**
Why Customer Journey Mapping? - Visualizing the chronological order of transactions for a customer provides insights into their interactions with the boutique.
Generative AI's Role - GPT-3.5 assisted in generating concise code for creating insightful visualizations, making the interpretation of customer journeys a breeze.
5. **Efficient Code for Supplier Insights**
What Supplier Insights Were Explored? - We delved into supplier distribution, profit analysis, and loyalty based on their location.
Generative AI's Role - Code generation with generative AI accelerated the process of exploring and visualizing supplier-related insights, optimizing the overall analysis.
